Pierce, Pierce mechanically measured the frequency (the number of wing vibrations per second) of chirps (or pulses of sound) made by a striped ground cricket, at various ground temperatures.  Since crickets are ectotherms (cold-blooded), the rate of their physiological processes and their overall metabolism are influenced by temperature.  Consequently, there is reason to believe that temperature would have a profound effect on aspects of their behavior, such as chirp frequency.\n","\n","In general, it was found that crickets did not sing at temperatures colder than 60ยบ F. or warmer than 100ยบ F."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{"id":"skpeRaXzlisy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1676037193858,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":6,"user":{"displayName":"SHARAN YADAVAL","userId":"12037477016265566304"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["ground_cricket_data = {\"Chirps/Second\": [20.0, 16.0, 19.8, 18.4, 17.1, 15.5, 14.7,\n","                                         15.7, 15.4, 16.3, 15.0, 17.2, 16.0, 17.0,\n","                                         14.4],\n","                       \"Ground Temperature\": [88.6, 71.6, 93.3, 84.3, 80.6, 75.2, 69.7,\n","                                              71.6, 69.4, 83.3, 79.6, 82.6, 80.6, 83.5,\n","                                              76.3]}\n","df = pd.DataFrame(ground_cricket_data)"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["import pandas as pd\n","from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression\n","from sklearn.metrics import r2_score\n","\n","\n","# Split the data into dependent and independent variables\n","X = df.iloc[:, 1].values.reshape(-1, 1)\n","y = df.iloc[:, 0].values.reshape(-1, 1)\n","\n","# Fit the linear regression model to the data\n","regressor = LinearRegression()\n","regressor.fit(X, y)\n","\n","# Make predictions using the fitted model\n","y_pred = regressor.predict(X)\n","\n","# Coefficient and intercept of the linear regression line\n","coefficient = regressor.coef_\n","intercept = regressor.intercept_\n","\n","# Calculate the R-squared score\n","r2 = r2_score(y, y_pred)\n","r2"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"z8eSSDremAMY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1676037208346,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11,"user":{"displayName":"SHARAN YADAVAL","userId":"12037477016265566304"}},"outputId":"8299b18a-9556-4a7d-9f0c-61a737a898e0"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.6922946529146998"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":4}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"A5bba214lisz"},"source":["### Tasks\n","\n","1.
